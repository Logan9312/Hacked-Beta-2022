# Hacked-Beta-2022

Unfinished. The goal of the project was to build a system that could plan your route by checking the temperature outside, and calculating how long you could survive before getting frostbite to determine if it was safe to walk to your destination. This was my backup project after my first project fell flat, however it remains unfinished because I ran out of time.
